#Solution to Cartpole balancing problem with the help of reinforcement learning.

I highly recommend going through following blogs and videos if you are new to RL

2) Cartpole balancing with q learning: https://medium.com/@tuzzer/cart-pole-balancing-with-q-learning-b54c6068d947
3) An overview of reinforcement learning teaching machines to play games: https://pythonmachinelearning.pro/an-overview-of-reinforcement-learning-teaching-machines-to-play-games/

The code is well explaind by blog no 2 and 3 and it works very well using Q learning algorithm by stabilizing the pole for 200 timsteps but you can reach out to me on isaacpatole4u@gmail.com if you find yourself stuck at any point. 
I have also tried (and trying) to solve the problem using Sarsa but it turns out that it is not as efficient as Q learning.
